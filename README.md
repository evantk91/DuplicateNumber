# DupicateNumber

You have been given an array of length n. The array contains integers from 0 to n - 2. Each number in the array is present exactly once except for the one number which is present twice. Find and return this duplicate number present in the array.

arr = [0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 3]
output = 3

The expected time complexity for this problem is O(n) and the expected space complexity is O(1)
